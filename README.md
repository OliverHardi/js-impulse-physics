# js-impulse-physics
A simple rigid body physics engine in javascript

supports convex irregular polygons

implements:
- a simple AABB broadphase
- SAT narrowphase with contact generation
- friction and inertia
- substepping and framerate-independent simulation

use arrow keys to move the main object in the demo
